    "## IBM Quantum Computers: Technical Context\n",
    "IBM's quantum computers are based on superconducting qubits. These qubits operate at cryogenic temperatures (close to absolute zero) to achieve superconductivity, where resistance disappears in certain materials.IBM's superconducting quantum computers operate at an ultra-low temperature of approximately 15 millikelvin (mK), which is equivalent to -459.63°F. This temperature is necessary to maintain the superconducting state of qubits by eliminating thermal noise and ensuring quantum coherence. The extreme cooling is achieved using dilution refrigerators, enabling the qubits to perform high-fidelity quantum operations while minimizing decoherence and noise. This technical capability is a cornerstone of IBM's quantum computing technology, allowing for stable quantum states essential for executing quantum algorithms effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Superconducting qubits use Josephson junctions to enable quantum behavior. These junctions allow for the creation and manipulation of quantum states, such as superposition and entanglement.\n",
    "IBM's quantum computers employ microwave pulses to control and measure qubits. Error correction and mitigation are critical challenges, and ongoing improvements are made to enhance qubit coherence times, gate fidelity, and overall system performance."

We know from theory that 50% of the time we should measure the 0 state and 50% of the time we should measure the 1 state. This means in a perfect world we would expect to see 2000 shots being measured in the 0 state and 2000 shots being measured in the 1 state."
